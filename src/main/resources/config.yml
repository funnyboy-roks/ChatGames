# This is the reward given to the player after successfully winning a game

# Lists of words for the games to choose from.
# Each entry in this list has a simple format: <source>:<name>
# There are three sources that one can choose from: minecraft, chatgames, and custom
# for minecraft, one can use minecraft:blocks, minecraft:items, or minecraft:mobs.
#     By default, these use the en_us version for translations, but different translations can be added by copying one of minecraft's lang files to a file called `translations.json` in ChatGames folder
#     I have a guide for getting these lang files: https://blog.funnyboyroks.com/getting-mc-lang-files
# for chatgames, one can use chatgames:countries.  More may be added in the future.
# for custom, one can use any custom list they want.  To use a custom list, put it in the `lists/` folder and use the filename for <name>
#     Ex: if I had a file called `my_list.txt`, I'd use `custom:my_list.txt` in the list.
word-lists:
  - minecraft:blocks
  - minecraft:items
  - chatgames:countries
